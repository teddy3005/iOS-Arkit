# iOS-Arkit
Using CoreLocation, MapKit, and ARKit. The app starts with a display screen with the title as a 
button and when clicked upon the phone's camera is activated. A 3d drone object appears and it has a controller 
on the bottom of the screen input where you want the object to go. Also added Apple's mapkit to have the ability 
to search a location and directions posted on map view.
